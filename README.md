The **openMINDS_chemicals** repository hosts one of the metadata models of the **openMINDS metadata framework**. It defines modular metadata schemas for describing chemical substances and mixtures.

To generally learn more about the openMINDS metadata framework please go to :arrow_right: [**ReadTheDocs**][docu-url].  
There you can also explore directly the :arrow_right: [**openMINDS_chemicals schema specifications**][docu-chemicals-url].

## How to cite

For referencing specificly the openMINDS_chemicals metadata model, please use the following RRID Portal record:  
:arrow_right:  `openMINDS chemicals metadata model (RRID:SCR_026248)`  

Please reference in addition openMINDS in general, using our main RRID Portal record:

## Funding and acknowledgements

The openMINDS metadata framework development started in the [**Human Brain Project (HBP)**][hbp-website], funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Specific Grant Agreements [**SGA-1 (No.720270)**][hbp-sga1-doi], [**SGA-2 (No.785907)**][hbp-sga2-doi], and [**SGA-3 (No. 945539)**][hbp-sga3-doi]. 

The framework is further developed as part of the EBRAINS 2.0 project, funded European Union's Research and Innovation Program Horizon Europe under Grant Agreement [**GA (No.101147319)**][ebrains2-doi].

The framework also receives support from the [**Helmholtz International BigBrain Analytics and Learning Laboratory (HIBALL)**][hiball-url].

## Collaboration partners

The openMINDS metadata framework is closely collaborating with the [**InterLex Project**][interlex-dashboard] of the [**SciCrunch Data and Resource Infrastructure**][scicrunch-website] and the [**KnowledgeSpace**][ks-website] hosted by the [**International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)**][incf-website].
